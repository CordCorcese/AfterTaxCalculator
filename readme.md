This command line tool provides an estimate of how much an individual working in British Columbia Canada would take home after tax. This calculator does not address capital gains, or other non standard forms of income. 

This calculator takes into account federal and provincal taxes in BC, and applies the basic personal tax credit. EI and CPP contributions are accounted for as well. 

Note that this tool can only provide an estimate and accuracy can not be guaranteed. The complexity of Canada's tax code means that anyone seeking serious financial advice should contact a financial expert for advice specific to their situation.
